We're collecting used laptops for 1000+ families in need. Kids and teens around the world are struggling with their homework because they don't have access to computers.

## Problem Statement:
Over 1000 families in Los Angeles County don't have access to technology at home, so their children fall behind in school. Without computers, teens or their parents can't easily prepare for college or jobs. Lack of technology also means they have trouble meeting their basic needs for food, healthcare, and housing. Meanwhile, over 1000 laptops sit unused on shelves because their owners upgraded to new laptops, and because of the lack of reputable laptop donation programs. Even the best laptop donation programs involve shipping the laptops to families over long distances or could use greater engagement with recipient families following the gifts of laptops.
